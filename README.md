# Chat-Apllication-using-Java-and-Swing

This project is built on Java and also Swing has been used for GUI with concepts of OOPs and Multithreading and Exception. This application can be used to chat with different numbers and other numbers can't see the messages and has been shared by other numbers. Here client server architecture is used.

Please, suggest ideas to make it more advanced or in a easy way.

Thank you.
